Online Social Networks OSNs are ubiquitous, with more than 70% of Internet users being active users of such networking services. This widespread use of OSNs brings with it big threats and challenges, privacy being one of them. Most OSNs today offer a limited set of (static) privacy settings and do not allow for the definition, even less enforcement, of more dynamic privacy policies. In this abstract we are concerned with the specification and enforcement of dynamic (and recurrent) privacy policies that are activated or deactivated by context (events) or time. We describe two approaches: Policy automata, a transition system where privacy policies are defined by state; and TFPPF a formal framework for privacy policies where users can specify the time frame when a privacy policy must be enforced. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges of these approaches.
